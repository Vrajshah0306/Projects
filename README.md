## Bill Calculator

**Description**:  
The **Bill Calculator** is a simple and user-friendly web application designed to split a bill among multiple people. It calculates the cost per person, taking into account tax, gratuity, and tips. This was my first project, and it allowed me to practice front-end web development and JavaScript programming.

**Features**:
- Input fields for total bill, tax percentage, gratuity, tip, and number of people.
- Calculates and displays the cost per person.
- Validates user inputs and displays appropriate error messages.
- Simple and responsive design.

**Technologies Used**:
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic and functionality.

**Challenges Solved**:
- Learned how to handle input validation and error messages effectively.
- Designed a clear and intuitive user interface.
- Gained confidence in working with JavaScript and manipulating the DOM.

## Tic-Tac-Toe

**Description**:  
**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a simple web-based game that allows two players to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game keeps track of scores, highlights the winning boxes, and features an option to toggle color schemes for the board.

**Features**:
- Two-player functionality with alternating turns.
- Score tracking for Player X, Player O, and draws.
- Win detection and highlighting of the winning boxes.
- Reset options: reset the board, scores, or everything.
- Toggle between two color schemes for the board.

**Technologies Used**:
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic, win detection, and interactivity.

**Challenges Solved**:
- Implemented win detection logic to identify winners and handle draws.
- Ensured user inputs were validated to prevent multiple clicks on the same square.
- Designed a dynamic interface with color scheme toggling and responsive feedback.
