## Bill Calculator

**Description**:  
The **Bill Calculator** is a simple and user-friendly web application designed to split a bill among multiple people. It calculates the cost per person, taking into account tax, gratuity, and tips.

**Features**:
- Input fields for total bill, tax percentage, gratuity, tip, and number of people.
- Calculates and displays the cost per person.
- Validates user inputs and displays appropriate error messages.
- Simple and responsive design.

**Technologies Used**:
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic and functionality.

**Challenges Solved**:
- Learned how to handle input validation and error messages effectively.
- Designed a clear and intuitive user interface.
- Gained confidence in working with JavaScript and manipulating the DOM.
